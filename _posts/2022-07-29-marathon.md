# DFS

### How to Solve Graph Problems
* My initial approach didn’t use a graph structure, which led to overly complex and unnecessary data structures (like in `marathon.cpp`) and eventually hit a dead end.
* **When solving a graph problem, build the graph first.**

```c++
int V, E, u, v, d;
int edge[27], val[27][27], node[27][27], visit[27];
int ans[27],  course[27];
int a_cnt, c_cnt = 0, D, min_d = 21, goal_d = 42;
int cur_max = 0;
```

* Start by setting up the graph-related variables like above.

```c++
int	main(void){
	my_input();
	DFS(0, 0);
	choose_optimal();
}
```

* Once the input is received, begin DFS immediately based on the values provided.

### Inside the DFS

* If the current vertex is `'a'`, stop the process — that means we’ve reached the destination → check if the current vertex is `'a'` using an `if` statement.
  * If we’ve arrived, we need to record the path we've taken so far.
* If the vertex is not `'a'`, check whether we’ve visited it before.
  * If it hasn’t been visited, go deeper into the recursion (i.e., move to a deeper level of DFS).

### Difficult Parts
* One of the hardest parts is figuring out how to handle the `visited` matrix when arriving at `'a'`.
* I keep getting stuck because of how to reset or manage the visited array correctly.

### DFS Thought Process
* Define a clear **termination condition** — when should the recursion stop?
* Use a loop to go through all the next possible connected vertices from the current node, and recursively DFS each of them.
* After returning from DFS, remove the selected node from the visited array and the path array to backtrack properly.

### Current Problem
* For some reason, when I set the destination to `'a'`, the number of valid paths that meet the problem’s constraints is **zero**...
* I’m not sure why this is happening — need to figure out how to fix it.
