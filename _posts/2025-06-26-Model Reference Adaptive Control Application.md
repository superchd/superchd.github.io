DMRAC(continuously updates its parameters) vs classical pid (PID controllers use fixed gains)

Adaptability vs non-adaptive techniques



in the robust multi-agent synchronization 



Problem : efficient synchronization -> cause : variations in their dynamics and parameters,

Solve : adaptive control framework can accomodate differences in the model parameters of individual drones within a network.
