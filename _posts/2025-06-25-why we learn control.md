Control theory acts as a **unifying framework** across all fields of engineering.  
By understanding control systems, engineers can model, analyze, and regulate diverse systems to behave in a desired way — even in the presence of disturbances or uncertainties.

## 💡 Examples by Field

> Control theory helps solve domain-specific problems across disciplines:

- **Electrical Engineering (EE)**  
  ➤ Designing switching power regulators with feedback stability

- **Mechanical Engineering (ME)**  
  ➤ Managing vibrations using dampers and isolation systems

- **Navigation Systems**  
  ➤ Enabling *dead reckoning*: computing position by estimating displacement over time

- **Climate Prediction**  
  ➤ Modeling atmospheric behavior using differential equations driven by forces like the **Coriolis effect**

## 🧠 Control Systems Are More Than Just PID and Inverted Pendulums

A modern control system involves a complete engineering process, including:

- 📐 **Modeling**  
  Representing real-world systems mathematically

- 🔁 **Simulation**  
  Predicting future behavior under given inputs

- ⚙️ **Dynamic Interaction**  
  Understanding how different components influence each other

- 🔇 **Filtering**  
  Suppressing noise and rejecting external disturbances

- 🧩 **Hardware Selection**  
  Choosing and integrating sensors and actuators

- 🧪 **Testing**  
  Verifying robustness under varying conditions

- 🧠 **System-Level Thinking**  
  Gaining deep understanding of the system’s internal mechanisms
